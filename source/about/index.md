Hi, I'm Tom Burns.

I'm a software developer living in Chicago. I've been working in iOS for the last few years, and in that time I've had the privilege of helping companies like [PillPack][pillpack-itunes], [Imgur][imgur-itunes], and [Porsche][porsche-itunes] bring amazing mobile experiences to their users.

I do other things, too. These frequently involve fermentation; I had a sourdough starter as a teenager, and I currently have a dedicated vessel in the house for making sauerkraut. I **might** be blogging about this stuff and/or the computer stuff [here][blog].

You can find me in various places around the web too, usually as the rough equivalent of `@tomburns`. Feel free to [email me][contact-email] directly if you'd prefer.
